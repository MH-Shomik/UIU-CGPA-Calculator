## ü§ñ Key Functionality: AI Study Planner

The core of the "smart" functionality comes from the integration with the Google Gemini API.

When a user requests a study plan:
1.  The application gathers all the relevant data: previous CGPA, credits completed, and the list of new courses with their grades.
2.  This data is formatted into a detailed prompt.
3.  A `POST` request is sent to the Gemini API endpoint.
4.  The AI model processes the prompt and returns a detailed, personalized study plan in Markdown format.
5.  The application then parses this Markdown and renders it as clean, readable HTML inside a modal window for the user to review.
